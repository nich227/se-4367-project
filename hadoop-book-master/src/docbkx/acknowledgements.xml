        I would like to express gratitude to my editors, co-authors, colleagues, and bosses
        who shared the thorny path to working clusters - with the hope to make it less thorny for
        those who follow. Seriously, folks, Hadoop is hard, and Big Data is tough, and there are
        many related products and skills that you need to master. Therefore, have fun,

        ,
        and I hope you will find the book entertaining.
