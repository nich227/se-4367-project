                    That you are on a Unix-like system.  Windows users may be
                    able to achieve this by installing Cygwin, but are probably better
                    served by running this lab inside a virtual machine.

            <listitem> 
                <para> 
                    Hadoop is already installed on your box in pseudo-distributed mode,
                    which means that your box has all the hadoop daemons (services) running.
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
        <para>
            With that said, let's get started.
        </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Checking out the Hadoop Daemons</title>
        <para>
            First, let's go to a command prompt and we'll check to make sure that
            the hadoop processes are indeed running. Go to a command prompt and
            type the following:
        </para>
        <programlisting>
            $ ps -eaf | grep java
        </programlisting>
        <para>
            A note: in this guide we display the prompt as '$' -- don't actually
            TYPE the dollar sign for the prompt.
        </para>
        <para>
            Once you should see a long output of running java processes, including
            those which are not hadoop-related (like eclipse, for instance). An
            example output (edited for brevity) is the following:
        </para>
        <programlisting>
            hduser   11930     1  0 Mar05 pts/2    00:07:32 
            /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-oracle/bin/java -Dproc_namenode -Xmx1000m ...

            hduser   12462     1  0 Mar05 ?        00:08:31 
            /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-oracle/bin/java -Dproc_datanode -Xmx1000m ...

            hduser   12847     1  0 Mar05 ?        00:05:56 
            /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-oracle/bin/java -Dproc_secondarynamenode ...

            hduser   12940     1  0 Mar05 pts/2    00:06:54 
            /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-oracle/bin/java -Dproc_jobtracker -Xmx1000m ...

            hduser   13295     1  0 Mar05 ?        00:09:49 
            /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-oracle/bin/java -Dproc_tasktracker -Xmx1000m
        </programlisting>
        <para>
            Again, I have snipped the output of each of these, ps will
            dump all of the command line arguments including a lengthy
            classpath.
        </para>
        <para>
            Note that there are five (5) separate processes related to
            Hadoop: the Namenode, DataNode, SecondaryNameNode,
            JobTracker, and TaskTracker.  If there are fewer than five
            processes, hadoop may installed, but in either local mode,
            or in fully distributed mode (as part of a cluster).  As we
            said, we're assuming that this machine is in
            pseudo-distributed mode.
        </para>
        <para>
            A shorthand way to run this could be to run the command jps,
            which is part of the Oracle 6 JDK, which should be in your
            path.
        </para>
        <programlisting>
            $ jps
            12940 JobTracker
            4902 Jps
            13295 TaskTracker
            12462 DataNode
            12847 SecondaryNameNode
            11930 NameNode
        </programlisting>
        <para>
            Note that the output of this shows both jps itself and the
            five hadoop daemons.  This may not show anything,
            however. If it does not show anything it could be because
            your hadoop daemons are running under a different user (for
            instance, as root). If so, don't be overly concerned about
            that.
        </para>
        <para>
            If none of these processes are running on either the ps or
            jps commands, this is an indication that hadoop needs to be
            started on your system.  Going to your Hadoop home directory
            under the bin/ sub-directory, there is a run-all.sh script
            you could run that starts hadoop.
        </para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Ensuring that the "hadoop" Command works</title>
        <para>
            We need to ensure that the hadoop command exists on your
            system.  Open up the terminal window and try typing the
            following command:
        </para>
        <programlisting>
            $ hadoop
        </programlisting>
        <para>
            If hadoop is in your path and properly configured, you should get the
            following:
        </para>
        <programlisting>
            Usage: hadoop [--config confdir] COMMAND
            where COMMAND is one of:
            ....
        </programlisting>
        <para>
            It will then list the commands.
        </para>
        <para>
            If you get an error message, you probably need to set up your
            path to include the hadoop bin directory.  That could be in
            one of the following locations:
        </para>
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                /usr/lib/hadoop/bin
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                /usr/local/hadoop/bin
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                /usr/share/hadoop/bin
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                etc.
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>
            You can fix your path in this shell window by using the following command:
        </para>
        <programlisting>
            $ export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/hadoop/location/bin
        </programlisting>
        <para>
            where clearly you need to find the proper location of your
            hadoop executable.  For those new to *nix systems, one could
            do that by executing the following:
        </para>
        <programlisting>
            $ ls /usr/lib/hadoop/bin
        </programlisting>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Checking out the web interface</title>
        <para>
            One of the main tools for monitoring Hadoop is by the web
            interfaces to the 5 different services.  Let us try using a
            web browser to see that.
        </para>
        <para>
            Open a web browser (for instance, Firefox or Google Chrome).
            If you do not have a windowing system (for instance, if you
            are remotely logged into a server), you may be able to use the
            command line browser lynx (more common), or w3m.
        </para>
        <para>
            Navigate your chosen browser to the following:
        </para>
        <programlisting>
            http://localhost:50070/
        </programlisting>
        <para>
            lynx users can simply type "lynx http://localhost:50070/" at
            the command line. Despite the obvious limitations lynx does a
            respectable job on these pages.
        </para>
        <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>
                <imagedata fileref="images/lab1-namenode.png" format="PNG" scale="100" />
            </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
        <para>
            This is the NameNode information page.  You can see some
            statistics on the usage of your Hadoop NameNode here.  We
            won't worry too much about the detais.
        </para>
        <para>
            Now, let's try the jobtracker page at:
        </para>
        <programlisting>
            http://localhost:50030/
        </programlisting>
        <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>
                <imagedata fileref="images/lab1-jobtracker.png" format="PNG" scale="100" />
            </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
        <para>
            This is the JobTracker information page.  Take a look at what
            it offers -- note that it gives information on running map and
            reduce tasks -- you probably don't have any at the moment.
        </para>
        <para>
            This is the NameNode information page.  You can see some
            statistics on the usage of your Hadoop NameNode here.  We
            won't worry too much about the detais.
        </para>
        <para>
            Finally, let's see the TaskTracker at:
        </para>
        <programlisting>
            http://localhost:50060/
        </programlisting>
        <mediaobject>
            <imageobject>
                <imagedata fileref="images/lab1-tasktracker.png" format="PNG" scale="100" />
            </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
        <para>
            This will also show something about tasks, which won't be
            running.  Note that in Hadoop lingo, a Job is total work that
            is being done, while a Task is an individual map or reduce.
            There can be hundreds of tasks in one job.
        </para>

                <para> 
                    Hadoop consists of 5 daemons: NameNode,
                    SecondaryNameNode, DataNode, JobTracker, and
                    TaskTracker.  A pseudo-distributed system has all 5
                    daemons running on one machine, which is common for
                    developers.
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem> 
                <para>
                    One can quickly verify that daemons are running using
                    the ps -eaf or the jps command.
                </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem> 
                <para> 
                    It is important to make sure your hadoop/bin directory
                    is in your path. This could be located at
                    /usr/lib/hadoop/bin, but varies based on distribution.
                </para>
                <para>
                    The NameNode, JobTracker, and TaskTracker daemons can be
                    interfaced with their respective web interfaces.

            You're done -- congradulations!  You just checked to make
            sure that your Hadoop daemons are running, you ensured your
            path was set up properly, and then you viewed the web
            interface for three of your Hadoop Daemons.
