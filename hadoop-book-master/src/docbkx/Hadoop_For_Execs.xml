    <title>Hadoop for Executives</title>
    <para>
        This section is a quick 'fact sheet' in a Q&amp;A format.
    </para>
    <bridgehead>
        What is Hadoop?
    </bridgehead>
    <para>
        Hadoop is an open source software stack that runs on a cluster of machines.  Hadoop provides distributed storage and distributed processing for very large data sets.
    </para>

    <bridgehead>
        What is the license of Hadoop?
    </bridgehead>
    <para>
        Hadoop is open source software.  It is an Apache project released under Apache Open Source License v2.0.  This license is very commercial friendly.
    </para>

    <bridgehead>
        Who contributes to Hadoop?
    </bridgehead>
    <para>
        Originally Hadoop was developed and open sourced by Yahoo.  Now Hadoop is developed as an Apache Software Foundation project and has numerous contributors from Cloudera, Horton Works, Facebook, etc.
    </para>

    <bridgehead>
        Isn't Hadoop used by foo-foo social media companies and not by enterprises
    </bridgehead>
    <para>
        Hadoop had its start in a Web company.  It was adopted pretty early by social media companies because the companies had Big Data problems and Hadoop offered a solution.
    </para>
    <para>
        However, Hadoop is now making inroads into Enterprises.
    </para>

    <bridgehead>
        I am not sure my company has a big data problem
    </bridgehead>
    <para>
        Hadoop is designed to deal with Big Data.  So if you don't have a 'Big Data Problem', then Hadoop probably isn't the best fit for your company.  But before you stop reading right here, please read on :-)
    </para>
    <para>
        How much data is considered Big Data, differs from company to company.  For some companies, 10 TB of data would be considered Big Data;  for others 1 PB would be 'Big Data'.  So only you can determine how much is Big Data.
    </para>
    <para>
        Also, if you don't have a 'Big Data problem' now, is that because you are not capturing some data?  In some scenarios, companies chose to forgo capturing data, because there wasn't a feasible way to store and process it.  Now that Hadoop can help with Big Data, it may be possible to start capturing data that wasn't captured before.
    </para>


    <bridgehead>
        How much does it cost to adopt Hadoop?
    </bridgehead>
    <para>
        Hadoop is open source.  The software is free.  However running Hadoop does have other cost components.
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            Cost of hardware : Hadoop runs on a cluster of machines.  The cluster size can be anywhere from 10 nodes to 1000s of nodes.  For a large cluster, the hardware costs will be significant.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            The cost of IT / OPS for standing up a large Hadoop cluster and supporting it will need to be factored in.
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            Since Hadoop is a newer technology, finding people to work on this ecosystem is not easy.
