        I am not a programmer, can I still use Hadoop?
    </bridgehead>
    <para>
        Yes, you don't need to write Java Map Reduce code to extract data out of Hadoop.  You can use Pig and Hive.  Both Pig and Hive offer 'high level' Map Reduce.  For example you can query Hadoop  using SQL in Hive.
